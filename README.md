# python-fairbilling

## About Project
This is a Fair Billing Demo application which accepts session log file as an input  and returns billing summarry information in terms of number of Sessions, total seconds used 

### Criteria
    
1. Each Log file contains information in <Timestamp Username Session> format where timestamp is in HH:MM:SS format, Username is alphanumerical, Session must be 'Start' or 'End'
2. File contains in plain text in above format as #1 with multiple lines as multiple records
3. Any record in an invalid format,will be skipped

#### Assumptions
1. Log file data in the input will be correctly ordered chronologically
2. All records in the file will be from within a single day (i.e. they will
not span midnight).
3. AS given in the example description , following 

### Built with
 * Python 3.x.x

#### Prerequisite
 * Python 3.x.x
 * Bash Terminal(Linux) or Cmd (Windows)
 

### Usage 

    ```python billing.py <inputfile> 
    ``` 

    If provided valid input file with required format, it shall print the output similar as described in [Requirement Specification](#Requirement Specification)

    There are 11 input files which covers different test scenarios like, Multiple Start and End, Only Start, Only End, Blank files, invalid entries etc


#### Requirement Specification 

You work for a hosted application provider which charges for the use of its application by the duration of sessions. There is a charge
per second of usage. The usage data comes from a log file that lists the time at which a session starts or stops (in the format
HH:MM:SS), the name of the user (which is a single alphanumeric string, of arbitrary length) and whether this is the start or end of
the session, like this:
  
  ```
  14:02:03 ALICE99 Start 
  14:02:05 CHARLIE End 
  14:02:34 ALICE99 End 
  14:02:58 ALICE99 Start 
  14:03:02 CHARLIE Start 
  14:03:33 ALICE99 Start 
  14:03:35 ALICE99 End 
  14:03:37 CHARLIE End 
  14:04:05 ALICE99 End 
  14:04:23 ALICE99 End 
  14:04:41 CHARLIE Start

```

Unfortunately, the developer of the application omitted some vital information from the log file. There is no indicator which start and
end lines are paired together. Even more unfortunately, the log files are re-written on a regular basis, so sessions may overlap the time
boundaries of the log file. In other words, there may be “End” entries for sessions that were already in progress when the log file
started, which will have no preceding “Start”. Similarly, when the log files are retrieved, there may be sessions still in progress that
have a “Start” but no “End”.
Your task is to take the log file and to print out a report of the users, the number of sessions, and the minimum possible total
duration of their sessions in seconds that is consistent with the data in the file. As you can see in the example above, a user can also
have more than one session active concurrently. Where there is an “End” with no possible matching start, the start time should be
assumed to be the earliest time of any record in the file. Where there is a “Start” with no possible matching “End”, the end time
should be assumed to be the latest time of any record in the file. So, for a file containing only these records:

  ```14:02:03 ALICE99 Start 
  14:02:05 CHARLIE End 
  14:02:34 ALICE99 End
  ```
  
the start time for CHARLIE's record should be assumed to be the earliest time in the file, i.e. 14:02:03. Similarly for the first example
above:
 ``` ... 
  14:04:05 ALICE99 End 
  14:04:23 ALICE99 End 
  14:04:41 CHARLIE Star
```
the last record is a “Start” and there are no later records at all so CHARLIE's last session will be considered to have finished at
14:04:41, i.e. it will be 0 seconds in duration.
Putting this all together, the results for the original data shown above would be as follows (name, sessions and total time):
ALICE99 4 240 
CHARLIE 3 37
Your program should take a single command line parameter, which will be the path to the data file to read. You can assume that the
data in the input will be correctly ordered chronologically, and that all records in the file will be from within a single day (i.e. they will
not span midnight).
Finally, you should note that, as with most log files, there may be other invalid or irrelevant data within the file. Therefore, any lines
that do not contain a valid time-stamp, username and a Start or End marker should be silently ignored and not included in any
calculations.
